-- type declarations for cosmo.unix

--- Shared memory for inter-process communication.
--- Provides atomic operations and wait/wake primitives for synchronization.
--- unix.Memory encapsulates memory that's shared across fork() and
--- this module provides the fundamental synchronization primitives.
--- Redbean memory maps may be used in two ways:
--- 1. as an array of bytes a.k.a. a string
--- 2. as an array of words a.k.a. integers
--- They're aliased, union, or overlapped views of the same memory.
--- For example if you write a string to your memory region, you'll
--- be able to read it back as an integer.
--- Reads, writes, and word operations will throw an exception if a
--- memory boundary error or overflow occurs.
local record Memory
  --- The starting byte index from which memory is copied, which defaults to zero.
  --- If `bytes` is none or nil, then the nul-terminated string at
  --- `offset` is returned. You may specify `bytes` to safely read
  --- binary data.
  --- This operation happens atomically. Each shared mapping has a
  --- single lock which is used to synchronize reads and writes to
  --- that specific map. To make it scale, create additional maps.
  read: function(self: Memory, offset?: number, bytes?: number): string
  --- Writes bytes to memory region.
  --- `offset` is the starting byte index to which memory is copied,
  --- which defaults to zero.
  --- If `bytes` is none or nil, then an implicit nil-terminator
  --- will be included after your `data` so things like json can
  --- be easily serialized to shared memory.
  --- This operation happens atomically. Each shared mapping has a
  --- single lock which is used to synchronize reads and writes to
  --- that specific map. To make it scale, create additional maps.
  write: function(self: Memory, data: string, offset?: number, bytes?: number)
  --- Loads word from memory region.
  --- This operation is atomic and has relaxed barrier semantics.
  load: function(self: Memory, word_index: number): number
  --- Stores word from memory region.
  --- This operation is atomic and has relaxed barrier semantics.
  store: function(self: Memory, word_index: number, value: number)
  --- Exchanges value.
  --- This sets word at `word_index` to `value` and returns the value
  --- previously held in by the word.
  --- This operation is atomic and provides the same memory barrier
  --- semantics as the aligned x86 LOCK XCHG instruction.
  xchg: function(self: Memory, word_index: number, value: number): number
  --- Compares and exchanges value.
  --- This inspects the word at `word_index` and if its value is the same
  --- as `old` then it'll be replaced by the value `new`, in which case
  --- `true, old` shall be returned. If a different value was held at
  --- word, then `false` shall be returned along with the word.
  --- This operation happens atomically and provides the same memory
  --- barrier semantics as the aligned x86 LOCK CMPXCHG instruction.
  cmpxchg: function(self: Memory, word_index: number, old: number, new: number): boolean, number
  --- Fetches then adds value.
  --- This method modifies the word at `word_index` to contain the sum of
  --- value and the `value` paremeter. This method then returns the value
  --- as it existed before the addition was performed.
  --- This operation is atomic and provides the same memory barrier
  --- semantics as the aligned x86 LOCK XADD instruction.
  fetch_add: function(self: Memory, word_index: number, value: number): number
  --- Fetches and bitwise ands value.
  --- This operation happens atomically and provides the same memory
  --- barrier ordering semantics as its x86 implementation.
  fetch_and: function(self: Memory, word_index: number, value: number): number
  --- Fetches and bitwise ors value.
  --- This operation happens atomically and provides the same memory
  --- barrier ordering semantics as its x86 implementation.
  fetch_or: function(self: Memory, word_index: number, value: number): number
  --- Fetches and bitwise xors value.
  --- This operation happens atomically and provides the same memory
  --- barrier ordering semantics as its x86 implementation.
  fetch_xor: function(self: Memory, word_index: number, value: number): number
  --- Waits for word to have a different value.
  --- This method asks the kernel to suspend the process until either the
  --- absolute deadline expires or we're woken up by another process that
  --- calls `unix.Memory:wake()`.
  --- The `expect` parameter is used only upon entry to synchronize the
  --- transition to kernelspace. The kernel doesn't actually poll the
  --- memory location. It uses `expect` to make sure the process doesn't
  --- get added to the wait list unless it's sure that it needs to wait,
  --- since the kernel can only control the ordering of wait / wake calls
  --- across processes.
  --- The default behavior is to wait until the heat death of the universe
  --- if necessary. You may alternatively specify an absolute deadline. If
  --- it's less than or equal to the value returned by clock_gettime, then
  --- this routine is non-blocking. Otherwise we'll block at most until
  --- the current time reaches the absolute deadline.
  --- Futexes are currently supported on Linux, FreeBSD, OpenBSD. On other
  --- platforms this method calls sched_yield() and will either (1) return
  --- unix.EINTR if a deadline is specified, otherwise (2) 0 is returned.
  --- This means futexes will *work* on Windows, Mac, and NetBSD but they
  --- won't be scalable in terms of CPU usage when many processes wait on
  --- one process that holds a lock for a long time. In the future we may
  --- polyfill futexes in userspace for these platforms to improve things
  --- for folks who've adopted this api. If lock scalability is something
  --- you need on Windows and MacOS today, then consider fcntl() which is
  --- well-supported on all supported platforms but requires using files.
  --- Please test your use case though, because it's kind of an edge case
  --- to have the scenario above, and chances are this op will work fine.
  --- `EINTR` if a signal is delivered while waiting on deadline. Callers
  --- should use futexes inside a loop that is able to cope with spurious
  --- wakeups. We don't actually guarantee the value at word has in fact
  --- changed when this returns.
  --- `EAGAIN` is raised if, upon entry, the word at `word_index` had a
  --- different value than what's specified at `expect`.
  --- `ETIMEDOUT` is raised when the absolute deadline expires.
  wait: function(self: Memory, word_index: number, expect: number, abs_deadline?: number, nanos?: number): number
  --- Wakes other processes waiting on word.
  --- This method may be used to signal or broadcast to waiters. The
  --- `count` specifies the number of processes that should be woken,
  --- which defaults to `INT_MAX`.
  --- The return value is the number of processes that were actually woken
  --- as a result of the system call. No failure conditions are defined.
  wake: function(self: Memory, index: number, count?: number): number
end

--- Directory handle for reading directory entries.
--- `unix.Dir` objects are created by `opendir()` or `fdopendir()`.
local record Dir
  --- Closes directory stream object and associated its file descriptor.
  --- This is called automatically by the garbage collector.
  --- This may be called multiple times.
  close: function(self: Dir): boolean
  --- Reads entry from directory stream.
  --- Returns `nil` if there are no more entries.
  --- On error, `nil` will be returned and `errno` will be non-nil.
  --- `kind` can be any of:
  --- - `DT_REG`: file is a regular file
  --- - `DT_DIR`: file is a directory
  --- - `DT_BLK`: file is a block device
  --- - `DT_LNK`: file is a symbolic link
  --- - `DT_CHR`: file is a character device
  --- - `DT_FIFO`: file is a named pipe
  --- - `DT_SOCK`: file is a named socket
  --- - `DT_UNKNOWN`
  --- Note: This function also serves as the `__call` metamethod, so that
  --- `unix.Dir` objects may be used as a for loop iterator.
  read: function(self: Dir): string, number, number, number
  --- Returns `EOPNOTSUPP` if using a `/zip/...` path or if using Windows NT.

  maxrss: function(self: Rusage): number
  --- If you chart memory usage over the lifetime of your process, then
  --- this would be the space filled in beneath the chart. The frequency
  --- of kernel scheduling is defined as `unix.CLK_TCK`.  Each time a tick

  --- This is only applicable to redbean if its built with MODE=tiny,

  --- Currently only available on FreeBSD and NetBSD.
  isrss: function(self: Rusage): number
  --- This number indicates how many times redbean was preempted by the
  --- kernel to `memcpy()` a 4096-byte page. This is one of the tradeoffs
  --- `fork()` entails. This number is usually tinier, when your binaries
  --- are tinier.
  --- Not available on Windows NT.
  minflt: function(self: Rusage): number
  --- Returns number of major page faults.
  --- This number indicates how many times redbean was preempted by the
  --- kernel to perform i/o. For example, you might have used `mmap()` to

  --- On Windows NT this is `NtProcessMemoryCountersEx::PageFaultCount`.
  majflt: function(self: Rusage): number
  --- Operating systems like to reserve hard disk space to back their RAM

  nvcsw: function(self: Rusage): number
  --- @return integer count number of non-consensual context switches.

--- File metadata and attributes.
--- Contains file size, permissions, ownership, and timestamps.
--- `unix.Stat` objects are created by `stat()` or `fstat()`.
--- Use `unix.S_ISDIR()`, `unix.S_ISREG()`, etc. to check file type from mode.
local record Stat
  size: function(self: Stat): number
  --- Contains file type and permissions.
  --- For example, `0010644` is what you might see for a file and

  --- File birth time.
  --- This field should be accurate on Apple, Windows, and BSDs. On Linux
  --- this is the minimum of atim/mtim/ctim. On Windows NT nanos is only

  --- Here's an example of how you might print a file timestamp:
  --- st = assert(unix.stat('/etc/passwd'))
  --- unixts, nanos = st:birthtim()
  --- year,mon,mday,hour,min,sec,gmtoffsec = unix.localtime(unixts)
  --- Write('%.4d-%.2d-%.2dT%.2d:%.2d:%.2d.%.9d%+.2d%.2d % {

  birthtim: function(self: Stat): number, number
  mtim: function(self: Stat): number, number
  --- Please note that file systems are sometimes mounted with `noatime`
  --- out of concern for i/o performance. Linux also provides `O_NOATIME`
  --- as an option for open().
  --- On Windows NT this is the same as birth time.
  atim: function(self: Stat): number, number
  --- Means time file status was last changed on UNIX.
  --- On Windows NT this is the same as birth time.
  ctim: function(self: Stat): number, number
  --- This provides some indication of how much physical storage a file
  --- actually consumes. For example, for small file systems, your system
  --- might report this number as being 8, which means 4096 bytes.
  blocks: function(self: Stat): number
  --- This field might be of assistance in computing optimal i/o sizes.
  --- Please note this field has no relationship to blocks, as the latter
  --- is fixed at a 512 byte size.
  blksize: function(self: Stat): number
  --- This can be used to detect some other process used `rename()` to swap
  --- out a file underneath you, so you can do a refresh. redbean does it
  --- during each main process heartbeat for its own use cases.
  --- On Windows NT this is set to `NtByHandleFileInformation::FileIndex`.
  ino: function(self: Stat): number
  --- On Windows NT this is set to `NtByHandleFileInformation::VolumeSerialNumber`.
  dev: function(self: Stat): number
  --- This value may be set to `0` or `-1` for files that aren't devices,
  --- depending on the operating system. `unix.major()` and `unix.minor()`
  --- may be used to extract the device numbers.

--- Error information from system calls.
--- Provides detailed error codes and human-readable descriptions.
--- This object is returned by system calls that fail. We prefer returning
--- an object because for many system calls, an error is part of their normal
--- operation. For example, it's often desirable to use the `errno()` method
--- when performing a `read()` to check for EINTR.
local record Errno
  --- The error number is always different for different platforms. On
  --- UNIX systems, error numbers occupy the range [1,127] in practice.
  --- The System V ABI reserves numbers as high as 4095. On Windows NT,
  --- error numbers can go up to 65535.
  errno: function(self: Errno): number
  --- On UNIX systems this is always 0. On Windows NT this will normally
  --- be the same as `errno(). Because Windows defines so many error codes,
  --- there's oftentimes a multimapping between its error codes and System
  --- Five. In those cases, this value reflects the `GetLastError()` result
  --- at the time the error occurred.
  winerr: function(self: Errno): number
  --- For example, this might return `"EINTR"`.
  name: function(self: Errno): string
  --- For example, this might return `"read"` if `read()` was what failed.
  call: function(self: Errno): string
  --- For example, this might return `"Interrupted system call"`.
  doc: function(self: Errno): string
  --- Different information components are delimited by slash.
  --- For example, this might return `"EINTR/4/Interrupted system call"`.
  --- On Windows NT this will include additional information about the
  --- Windows error (including FormatMessage() output) if the WIN32 error
  --- differs from the System Five error code.

  --- - `O_UNLINK`     automatically delete file upon close()
  --- - `O_SYNC`       makes file operations synchronize appropriately
  --- - `O_RSYNC`      synchronize read() operations
  --- - `O_DSYNC`      synchronize write() operations
  --- - `O_DIRECT`     it's complicated (not supported on Apple and OpenBSD)
  --- - `O_NOATIME`    don't record access time (zero on non-Linux)
  --- There are three regular combinations for the above flags:
  --- - `O_RDONLY`: Opens existing file for reading. If it doesn't exist
  --- then nil is returned and errno will be `ENOENT` (or in some other
  --- cases `ENOTDIR`).
  --- - `O_WRONLY|O_CREAT|O_TRUNC`: Creates file. If it already exists,
  --- then the existing copy is destroyed and the opened file will
  --- start off with a length of zero. This is the behavior of the
  --- traditional creat() system call.
  --- - `O_WRONLY|O_CREAT|O_EXCL`: Create file only if doesn't exist
  --- already. If it does exist then `nil` is returned along with
  --- `errno` set to `EEXIST`.
  --- `dirfd` defaults to to `unix.AT_FDCWD` and may optionally be set to
  --- a directory file descriptor to which `path` is relative.
  --- Returns `ENOENT` if `path` doesn't exist.
  --- Returns `ENOTDIR` if `path` contained a directory component that
  --- wasn't a directory
  --- .
  open: function(path: string, flags: number, mode?: number, dirfd?: number): number
  --- Closes file descriptor.
  --- This function should never be called twice for the same file
  --- descriptor, regardless of whether or not an error happened. The file
  --- descriptor is always gone after close is called. So it technically
  --- always succeeds, but that doesn't mean an error should be ignored.
  --- For example, on NFS a close failure could indicate data loss.
  --- Closing does not mean that scheduled i/o operations have been
  --- completed. You'd need to use fsync() or fdatasync() beforehand to
  --- ensure that. You shouldn't need to do that normally, because our
  --- close implementation guarantees a consistent view, since on systems
  --- where it isn't guaranteed (like Windows) close will implicitly sync.
  --- File descriptors are automatically closed on exit().
  --- Returns `EBADF` if `fd` wasn't valid.
  --- Returns `EINTR` possibly maybe.
  --- Returns `EIO` if an i/o error occurred.
  close: function(fd: number): boolean
  --- Reads from file descriptor.
  --- This function returns empty string on end of file. The exception is
  --- if `bufsiz` is zero, in which case an empty returned string means
  --- the file descriptor works.
  read: function(fd: number, bufsiz?: number, offset?: number): string
  --- Writes to file descriptor.
  write: function(fd: number, data: string, offset?: number): number
  --- Invokes `_Exit(exitcode)` on the process. This will immediately
  --- halt the current process. Memory will be freed. File descriptors
  --- will be closed. Any open connections it owns will be reset. This
  --- function never returns.
  exit: function(exitcode?: number)
  --- Returns raw environment variables.
  --- This allocates and constructs the C/C++ `environ` variable as a Lua
  --- table consisting of string keys and string values.
  --- This data structure preserves casing. On Windows NT, by convention,
  --- environment variable keys are treated in a case-insensitive way. It
  --- is the responsibility of the caller to consider this.
  --- This data structure preserves valueless variables. It's possible on
  --- both UNIX and Windows to have an environment variable without an
  --- equals, even though it's unusual.
  --- This data structure preserves duplicates. For example, on Windows,
  --- there's some irregular uses of environment variables such as how the
  --- command prompt inserts multiple environment variables with empty
  --- string as keys, for its internal bookkeeping.
  environ: function(): {string:string | nil}
  --- Sets environment variable.
  --- This wraps the C `setenv()` function to allow Lua scripts to set
  --- environment variables.
  --- @param name string environment variable name
  --- @param value string value to set
  --- @param overwrite? boolean if false, won't overwrite existing variables (defaults to true)
  --- @return true
  --- @overload fun(name: string, value: string, overwrite?: boolean): nil, error: unix.Errno
  setenv: function(name?: any, value?: any, overwrite?: any)
  --- Unsets environment variable.
  --- This wraps the C `unsetenv()` function to allow Lua scripts to remove
  --- environment variables.
  --- @param name string environment variable name to unset
  --- @return true
  --- @overload fun(name: string): nil, error: unix.Errno
  unsetenv: function(name?: any)
  --- Clears all environment variables.
  --- This wraps the C `clearenv()` function to allow Lua scripts to remove
  --- all environment variables at once.
  --- @return true
  --- @overload fun(): nil, error: unix.Errno
  clearenv: function()
  --- Gets login name of current user.
  --- This wraps the C `getlogin()` function to retrieve the login name
  --- associated with the current session.
  --- @return string login name
  --- @overload fun(): nil, error: unix.Errno
  getlogin: function()
  --- Creates a new process mitosis style.
  --- This system call returns twice. The parent process gets the nonzero
  --- pid. The child gets zero.
  --- Here's a simple usage example of creating subprocesses, where we
  --- fork off a child worker from a main process hook callback to do some
  --- independent chores, such as sending an HTTP request back to redbean.
  --- -- as soon as server starts, make a fetch to the server
  --- -- then signal redbean to shutdown when fetch is complete
  --- local onServerStart = function()
  --- if assert(unix.fork()) == 0 then
  --- local ok, headers, body = Fetch('http://127.0.0.1:8080/test')
  --- unix.kill(unix.getppid(), unix.SIGTERM)
  --- unix.exit(0)
  --- end
  --- end
  --- OnServerStart = onServerStart
  --- We didn't need to use `wait()` here, because (a) we want redbean to go
  --- back to what it was doing before as the `Fetch()` completes, and (b)
  --- redbean's main process already has a zombie collector. However it's
  --- a moot point, since once the fetch is done, the child process then
  --- asks redbean to gracefully shutdown by sending SIGTERM its parent.
  --- This is actually a situation where we *must* use fork, because the
  --- purpose of the main redbean process is to call accept() and create
  --- workers. So if we programmed redbean to use the main process to send
  --- a blocking request to itself instead, then redbean would deadlock
  --- and never be able to accept() the client.
  --- While deadlocking is an extreme example, the truth is that latency
  --- issues can crop up for the same reason that just cause jitter
  --- instead, and as such, can easily go unnoticed. For example, if you
  --- do soemething that takes longer than a few milliseconds from inside
  --- your redbean heartbeat, then that's a few milliseconds in which
  --- redbean is no longer concurrent, and tail latency is being added to
  --- its ability to accept new connections. fork() does a great job at
  --- solving this.
  --- If you're not sure how long something will take, then when in doubt,
  --- fork off a process. You can then report its completion to something
  --- like SQLite. Redbean makes having lots of processes cheap. On Linux
  --- they're about as lightweight as what heavyweight environments call
  --- greenlets. You can easily have 10,000 Redbean workers on one PC.
  --- Here's some benchmarks for fork() performance across platforms:
  --- Linux 5.4 fork      l:     97,200𝑐    31,395𝑛𝑠  [metal]
  --- FreeBSD 12 fork     l:    236,089𝑐    78,841𝑛𝑠  [vmware]
  --- Darwin 20.6 fork    l:    295,325𝑐    81,738𝑛𝑠  [metal]
  --- NetBSD 9 fork       l:  5,832,027𝑐 1,947,899𝑛𝑠  [vmware]
  --- OpenBSD 6.8 fork    l: 13,241,940𝑐 4,422,103𝑛𝑠  [vmware]
  --- Windows10 fork      l: 18,802,239𝑐 6,360,271𝑛𝑠  [metal]
  --- One of the benefits of using `fork()` is it creates an isolation
  --- barrier between the different parts of your app. This can lead to
  --- enhanced reliability and security. For example, redbean uses fork so
  --- it can wipe your ssl keys from memory before handing over control to
  --- request handlers that process untrusted input. It also ensures that
  --- if your Lua app crashes, it won't take down the server as a whole.
  --- Hence it should come as no surprise that `fork()` would go slower on
  --- operating systems that have more security features. So depending on
  --- your use case, you can choose the operating system that suits you.
  fork: function(): number | number
  --- Performs `$PATH` lookup of executable.
  --- unix = require 'unix'
  --- prog = assert(unix.commandv('ls'))
  --- unix.execve(prog, {prog, '-hal', '.'}, {'PATH=/bin'})
  --- unix.exit(127)
  --- If `prog` is an absolute path, then it's returned as-is. If `prog`
  --- contains slashes then it's not path searched either and will be
  --- returned if it exists. On Windows, it's recommended that you install
  --- programs from cosmos to c:/bin/ without any .exe or .com suffix, so
  --- they can be discovered like they would on UNIX. If you want to find
  --- a program like notepad on the $PATH using this function, then you
  --- need to specify "notepad.exe" so it includes the extension.
  commandv: function(prog: string): string
  --- Exits current process, replacing it with a new instance of the
  --- specified program. `prog` needs to be an absolute path, see
  --- commandv(). `env` defaults to to the current `environ`. Here's
  --- a basic usage example:
  --- unix.execve("/bin/ls", {"/bin/ls", "-hal"}, {"PATH=/bin"})
  --- unix.exit(127)
  --- `prog` needs to be the resolved pathname of your executable. You
  --- can use commandv() to search your `PATH`.
  --- `args` is a string list table. The first element in `args`
  --- should be `prog`. Values are coerced to strings. This parameter
  --- defaults to `{prog}`.
  --- `env` is a string list table. Values are coerced to strings. No
  --- ordering requirement is imposed. By convention, each string has its
  --- key and value divided by an equals sign without spaces. If this
  --- parameter is not specified, it'll default to the C/C++ `environ`
  --- variable which is inherited from the shell that launched redbean.
  --- It's the responsibility of the user to supply a sanitized environ
  --- when spawning untrusted processes.
  --- `execve()` is normally called after `fork()` returns `0`. If that isn't
  --- the case, then your redbean worker will be destroyed.
  --- This function never returns on success.
  --- `EAGAIN` is returned if you've enforced a max number of
  --- processes using `setrlimit(RLIMIT_NPROC)`.
  execve: function(prog: string, args: {string}, env: {string}): nil, Errno
  --- Executes program with PATH search.
  --- Unlike `execve()`, this function searches for `prog` in the
  --- directories listed in the `PATH` environment variable.
  --- If `argv` is not provided, it defaults to `{prog}`.
  --- This function never returns on success.
  execvp: function(prog: string, argv?: {string}): nil, Errno
  --- Executes program with PATH search and custom environment.
  --- Like `execvp()` but also allows specifying a custom environment.
  --- `envp` is a string list table where each string is typically
  --- in the form `"KEY=value"`. If not specified, inherits the
  --- current environment.
  --- This function never returns on success.
  execvpe: function(prog: string, argv: {string}, envp?: {string}): nil, Errno
  --- Executes program from file descriptor.
  --- This allows executing a program that has already been opened,
  --- which can be useful for executing programs that have been
  --- verified or for executing APE (Actually Portable Executable)
  --- binaries.
  --- `fd` is an open file descriptor pointing to an executable.
  --- `argv` is the argument vector passed to the program.
  --- `envp` is the environment. If not specified, inherits the
  --- current environment.
  --- This function never returns on success.
  fexecve: function(fd: number, argv: {string}, envp?: {string}): nil, Errno
  --- Spawns a new process.
  --- Unlike `fork()` + `execve()`, this uses `posix_spawn()` which
  --- can be more efficient on some platforms.
  --- `prog` must be an explicit path to the executable.
  --- `argv` is the argument vector passed to the program.
  --- `envp` is the environment. If not specified, inherits the
  --- current environment.
  --- Returns the child process id on success.
  spawn: function(prog: string, argv: {string}, envp?: {string}): number
  --- Spawns a new process with PATH search.
  --- Like `spawn()` but searches for `prog` in the directories
  --- listed in the `PATH` environment variable.
  --- Returns the child process id on success.
  spawnp: function(prog: string, argv: {string}, envp?: {string}): number
  --- Duplicates file descriptor.
  --- `newfd` may be specified to choose a specific number for the new
  --- file descriptor. If it's already open, then the preexisting one will
  --- be silently closed. `EINVAL` is returned if `newfd` equals `oldfd`.
  --- `flags` can have `O_CLOEXEC` which means the returned file
  --- descriptors will be automatically closed upon execve().
  --- `lowest` defaults to zero and defines the lowest numbered file
  --- descriptor that's acceptable to use. If `newfd` is specified then
  --- `lowest` is ignored. For example, if you wanted to duplicate
  --- standard input, then:
  --- stdin2 = assert(unix.dup(0, nil, unix.O_CLOEXEC, 3))
  --- Will ensure that, in the rare event standard output or standard
  --- error are closed, you won't accidentally duplicate standard input to
  --- those numbers.
  dup: function(oldfd: number, newfd?: number, flags?: number, lowest?: number): number
  --- Creates fifo which enables communication between processes.
  --- - `O_CLOEXEC`: Automatically close file descriptor upon execve()
  --- - `O_NONBLOCK`: Request `EAGAIN` be raised rather than blocking
  --- - `O_DIRECT`: Enable packet mode w/ atomic reads and writes, so long
  --- as they're no larger than `PIPE_BUF` (guaranteed to be 512+ bytes)
  --- with support limited to Linux, Windows NT, FreeBSD, and NetBSD.
  --- Returns two file descriptors: one for reading and one for writing.
  --- Here's an example of how pipe(), fork(), dup(), etc. may be used
  --- to serve an HTTP response containing the output of a subprocess.
  --- local unix = require "unix"
  --- ls = assert(unix.commandv("ls"))

  pipe: function(flags?: number): number, number
  --- Waits for subprocess to terminate.
  --- `pid` defaults to `-1` which means any child process. Setting
  --- `pid` to `0` is equivalent to `-getpid()`. If `pid < -1` then
  --- that means wait for any pid in the process group `-pid`. Then
  --- lastly if `pid > 0` then this waits for a specific process id
  --- Options may have `WNOHANG` which means don't block, check for
  --- the existence of processes that are already dead (technically
  --- speaking zombies) and if so harvest them immediately.
  --- Returns the process id of the child that terminated. In other
  --- cases, the returned `pid` is nil and `errno` is non-nil.
  --- The returned `wstatus` contains information about the process
  --- exit status. It's a complicated integer and there's functions
  --- that can help interpret it. For example:

  WTERMSIG: function(wstatus: number): number
  --- Returns process id of current process.
  --- This function does not fail.
  getpid: function(): number
  --- Returns process id of parent process.
  --- This function does not fail.
  getppid: function(): number
  --- Sends signal to process(es).
  --- The impact of this action can be terminating the process, or
  --- interrupting it to request something happen.
  --- `pid` can be:
  --- - `pid > 0` signals one process by id
  --- - `== 0`    signals all processes in current process group
  --- - `-1`      signals all processes possible (except init)
  --- - `< -1`    signals all processes in -pid process group
  --- `sig` can be:
  --- - `0`       checks both if pid exists and we can signal it
  --- - `SIGINT`  sends ctrl-c keyboard interrupt
  --- - `SIGQUIT` sends backtrace and exit signal
  --- - `SIGTERM` sends shutdown signal
  --- - etc.
  --- Windows NT only supports the kill() signals required by the ANSI C89
  --- standard, which are `SIGINT` and `SIGQUIT`. All other signals on the
  --- Windows platform that are sent to another process via kill() will be
  --- treated like `SIGKILL`.
  kill: function(pid: number, sig: number): boolean
  --- Sends signal to process group.
  --- This is similar to `kill()` but sends the signal to all processes
  --- in the specified process group.
  --- `pgrp` is the process group id. If 0, sends to the calling process's
  --- process group.
  --- `sig` can be any signal value (e.g., `SIGTERM`, `SIGKILL`, etc.).
  killpg: function(pgrp: number, sig: number): boolean

  --- - `AT_SYMLINK_NOFOLLOW`: do not follow symbolic links.
  access: function(path: string, how: number, flags?: number, dirfd?: number): boolean
  --- Makes directory.
  --- `path` is the path of the directory you wish to create.

  --- Fails with `ENOENT` if the parent directory of the directory you

  --- consider using makedirs() instead.
  --- Fails with `ENOTDIR` if a parent directory component existed that

  --- Fails with `ENAMETOOLONG` if the path is too long.
  mkdir: function(path: string, mode?: number, dirfd?: number): boolean
  --- Unlike mkdir() this convenience wrapper will automatically create

  --- will return success.
  --- `path` is the path of the directory you wish to create.
  --- `mode` is octal permission bits, e.g. `0755`.
  makedirs: function(path: string, mode?: number): boolean
  --- Creates a temporary directory with a unique name.

  mkdtemp: function(template: string): string
  --- Creates a temporary file with a unique name.
  --- `template` must end with "XXXXXX" which will be replaced with random

  rename: function(oldpath: string, newpath: string, olddirfd: number, newdirfd: number): boolean
  --- Creates hard link, so your underlying inode has two names.
  link: function(existingpath: string, newpath: string, flags: number, olddirfd: number, newdirfd: number): boolean
  --- Creates symbolic link.
  --- On Windows NT a symbolic link is called a "reparse point" and can

  --- automatically request the appropriate permissions.
  symlink: function(target: string, linkpath: string, newdirfd?: number): boolean
  --- Reads contents of symbolic link.
  --- Note that broken links are supported on all platforms. A symbolic
  --- link can contain just about anything. It's important to not assume
  --- that `content` will be a valid filename.
  --- On Windows NT, this function transliterates `\` to `/` and
  --- furthermore prefixes `//?/` to WIN32 DOS-style absolute paths,
  --- thereby assisting with simple absolute filename checks in addition
  --- to enabling one to exceed the traditional 260 character limit.
  readlink: function(path: string, dirfd?: number): string
  --- Returns absolute path of filename, with `.` and `..` components
  --- removed, and symlinks will be resolved.
  realpath: function(path: string): string
  --- Changes access and/or modified timestamps on file.
  --- `path` is a string with the name of the file.
  --- The `asecs` and `ananos` parameters set the access time. If they're
  --- none or nil, the current time will be used.
  --- The `msecs` and `mnanos` parameters set the modified time. If

  --- The nanosecond parameters (`ananos` and `mnanos`) must be on the
  --- interval [0,1000000000) or `unix.EINVAL` is raised. On XNU this is
  --- truncated to microsecond precision. On Windows NT, it's truncated to

  --- not available on old versions of Linux, e.g. RHEL5.
  --- `dirfd` is a file descriptor integer opened with `O_DIRECTORY`
  --- that's used for relative path names. It defaults to `unix.AT_FDCWD`.
  --- `flags` may have have any of the following flags bitwise or'd

  --- Acquires lock on file interval.
  --- POSIX Advisory Locks allow multiple processes to leave voluntary
  --- hints to each other about which portions of a file they're using.
  --- The command may be:
  --- - `F_SETLK` to acquire lock if possible
  --- - `F_SETLKW` to wait for lock if necessary
  --- `fd` is file descriptor of open() file.
  --- `type` may be one of:
  --- - `F_RDLCK` for read lock (default)
  --- - `F_WRLCK` for read/write lock
  --- - `F_UNLCK` to unlock
  --- `start` is 0-indexed byte offset into file. The default is zero.
  --- `len` is byte length of interval. Zero is the default and it means
  --- until the end of the file.
  --- `whence` may be one of:
  --- - `SEEK_SET` start from beginning (default)
  --- - `SEEK_CUR` start from current position
  --- - `SEEK_END` start from end
  --- Returns `EAGAIN` if lock couldn't be acquired. POSIX says this

  --- Acquires information about POSIX advisory lock on file.
  --- This function accepts the same parameters as fcntl(F_SETLK) and
  --- tells you if the lock acquisition would be successful for a given

  --- returned. If the lock would not have succeeded, then information
  --- about a conflicting lock is returned.
  --- Returned `type` may be `F_RDLCK` or `F_WRLCK`.
  --- Returned `pid` is the process id of the current lock owner.
  --- This function is currently not supported on Windows.
  --- Returns `EBADF` if `fd` wasn't open.
  fcntl: function(fd: number, cmd: number, ...: any): any

  --- Sets process group id the modern way.
  setpgid: function(pid: number, pgid: number): boolean
  --- Gets process group id the modern way.
  getpgid: function(pid: number)
  --- Sets session id.
  --- This function can be used to create daemons.
  --- Fails with `ENOSYS` on Windows NT.
  setsid: function(): number
  --- Daemonizes the current process.
  --- This function performs the standard Unix daemonization steps:
  --- forks, creates a new session, and optionally changes directory
  --- and redirects standard file descriptors.
  --- `nochdir` if true, the current working directory is not changed
  --- to `/`. Defaults to false (will change to `/`).
  --- `noclose` if true, stdin/stdout/stderr are not redirected to
  --- `/dev/null`. Defaults to false (will redirect to `/dev/null`).
  --- This is a convenience wrapper that combines `fork()`, `setsid()`,
  --- and related operations.
  daemon: function(nochdir?: boolean, noclose?: boolean): boolean
  --- Gets real user id.
  --- On Windows this system call is polyfilled by running `GetUserNameW()`

  --- This function does not fail.
  getuid: function(): number
  --- Sets real group id.
  --- On Windows this system call is polyfilled as getuid().
  --- This function does not fail.
  getgid: function(): number
  --- Gets effective user id.
  --- For example, if your redbean is a setuid binary, then getuid() will
  --- return the uid of the user running the program, and geteuid() shall
  --- return zero which means root, assuming that's the file owning user.
  --- On Windows this system call is polyfilled as getuid().
  --- This function does not fail.
  geteuid: function(): number
  --- Gets effective group id.
  --- On Windows this system call is polyfilled as getuid().
  --- This function does not fail.
  getegid: function(): number
  --- Changes root directory.
  --- Returns `ENOSYS` on Windows NT.
  chroot: function(path: string): boolean
  --- Sets user id.
  --- One use case for this function is dropping root privileges. Should
  --- you ever choose to run redbean as root and decide not to use the
  --- `-G` and `-U` flags, you can replicate that behavior in the Lua
  --- processes you spawn as follows:
  --- ok, err = unix.setgid(1000)  -- check your /etc/groups
  --- if not ok then Log(kLogFatal, tostring(err)) end
  --- ok, err = unix.setuid(1000)  -- check your /etc/passwd
  --- if not ok then Log(kLogFatal, tostring(err)) end
  --- If your goal is to relinquish privileges because redbean is a setuid
  --- binary, then things are more straightforward:
  --- ok, err = unix.setgid(unix.getgid())
  --- if not ok then Log(kLogFatal, tostring(err)) end
  --- ok, err = unix.setuid(unix.getuid())
  --- if not ok then Log(kLogFatal, tostring(err)) end
  --- See also the setresuid() function and be sure to refer to your local

  setgid: function(gid: number): boolean
  --- Sets real, effective, and saved user ids.
  --- If any of the above parameters are -1, then it's a no-op.
  --- Returns `ENOSYS` on Windows NT.
  --- Returns `ENOSYS` on Macintosh and NetBSD if `saved` isn't -1.
  setresuid: function(real: number, effective: number, saved: number): boolean
  --- Sets real, effective, and saved group ids.
  --- If any of the above parameters are -1, then it's a no-op.
  --- Returns `ENOSYS` on Windows NT.
  --- Returns `ENOSYS` on Macintosh and NetBSD if `saved` isn't -1.
  setresgid: function(real: number, effective: number, saved: number): boolean
  --- Sets file permission mask and returns the old one.
  --- This is used to remove bits from the `mode` parameter of functions
  --- like open() and mkdir(). The masks typically used are 027 and 022.
  --- Those masks ensure that, even if a file is created with 0666 bits,
  --- it'll be turned into 0640 or 0644 so that users other than the owner
  --- can't modify it.
  --- To read the mask without changing it, try doing this:
  --- mask = unix.umask(027)
  --- unix.umask(mask)
  --- On Windows NT this is a no-op and `mask` is returned.
  --- This function does not fail.
  umask: function(newmask: number): number
  --- Generates a log message, which will be distributed by syslogd.
  --- `priority` is a bitmask containing the facility value and the level
  --- value. If no facility value is ORed into priority, then the default
  --- value set by openlog() is used. If set to NULL, the program name is
  --- used. Level is one of `LOG_EMERG`, `LOG_ALERT`, `LOG_CRIT`,
  --- `LOG_ERR`, `LOG_WARNING`, `LOG_NOTICE`, `LOG_INFO`, `LOG_DEBUG`.
  --- This function currently works on Linux, Windows, and NetBSD. On
  --- WIN32 it uses the ReportEvent() facility.

  --- >: Benchmark(unix.clock_gettime)
  --- 126     393     571     1
  --- `clock` can be any one of of:
  --- - `CLOCK_REALTIME` returns a wall clock timestamp represented in
  --- nanoseconds since the UNIX epoch (~1970). It'll count time in the
  --- suspend state. This clock is subject to being smeared by various
  --- adjustments made by NTP. These timestamps can have unpredictable
  --- discontinuous jumps when clock_settime() is used. Therefore this
  --- clock is the default clock for everything, even pthread condition
  --- variables. Cosmopoiltan guarantees this clock will never raise
  --- `EINVAL` and also guarantees `CLOCK_REALTIME == 0` will always be
  --- the case. On Windows this maps to GetSystemTimePreciseAsFileTime().
  --- On platforms with vDSOs like Linux, Windows, and MacOS ARM64 this
  --- should take about 20 nanoseconds.
  --- - `CLOCK_MONOTONIC` returns a timestamp with an unspecified epoch,
  --- that should be when the system was powered on. These timestamps
  --- shouldn't go backwards. Timestamps shouldn't count time spent in
  --- the sleep, suspend, and hibernation states. These timestamps won't
  --- be impacted by clock_settime(). These timestamps may be impacted by
  --- frequency adjustments made by NTP. Cosmopoiltan guarantees this
  --- clock will never raise `EINVAL`. MacOS and BSDs use the word
  --- "uptime" to describe this clock. On Windows this maps to
  --- QueryUnbiasedInterruptTimePrecise().
  --- - `CLOCK_BOOTTIME` is a monotonic clock returning a timestamp with an
  --- unspecified epoch, that should be relative to when the host system
  --- was powered on. These timestamps shouldn't go backwards. Timestamps
  --- should also include time spent in a sleep, suspend, or hibernation
  --- state. These timestamps aren't impacted by clock_settime(), but
  --- they may be impacted by frequency adjustments made by NTP. This
  --- clock will raise an `EINVAL` error on extremely old Linux distros
  --- like RHEL5. MacOS and BSDs use the word "monotonic" to describe
  --- this clock. On Windows this maps to QueryInterruptTimePrecise().
  --- - `CLOCK_MONOTONIC_RAW` returns a timestamp from an unspecified
  --- epoch. These timestamps don't count time spent in the sleep,
  --- suspend, and hibernation states. Unlike `CLOCK_MONOTONIC` this
  --- clock is guaranteed to not be impacted by frequency adjustments or
  --- discontinuous jumps caused by clock_settime(). Providing this level
  --- of assurances may make this clock slower than the normal monotonic
  --- clock. Furthermore this clock may cause `EINVAL` to be raised if
  --- running on a host system that doesn't provide those guarantees,
  --- e.g. OpenBSD and MacOS on AMD64.
  --- - `CLOCK_REALTIME_COARSE` is the same as `CLOCK_REALTIME` except
  --- it'll go faster if the host OS provides a cheaper way to read the
  --- wall time. Please be warned that coarse can be really coarse.
  --- Rather than nano precision, you're looking at `CLK_TCK` precision,
  --- which can lag as far as 30 milliseconds behind or possibly more.
  --- Cosmopolitan may fallback to `CLOCK_REALTIME` if a faster less
  --- accurate clock isn't provided by the system. This clock will raise
  --- an `EINVAL` error on extremely old Linux distros like RHEL5.
  --- - `CLOCK_MONOTONIC_COARSE` is the same as `CLOCK_MONOTONIC` except
  --- it'll go faster if the host OS provides a cheaper way to read the
  --- unbiased time. Please be warned that coarse can be really coarse.
  --- Rather than nano precision, you're looking at `CLK_TCK` precision,
  --- which can lag as far as 30 milliseconds behind or possibly more.
  --- Cosmopolitan may fallback to `CLOCK_REALTIME` if a faster less
  --- accurate clock isn't provided by the system. This clock will raise
  --- an `EINVAL` error on extremely old Linux distros like RHEL5.
  --- - `CLOCK_PROCESS_CPUTIME_ID` returns the amount of time this process
  --- was actively scheduled. This is similar to getrusage() and clock().
  --- Cosmopoiltan guarantees this clock will never raise `EINVAL`.
  --- - `CLOCK_THREAD_CPUTIME_ID` returns the amount of time this thread
  --- was actively scheduled. This is similar to getrusage() and clock().
  --- Cosmopoiltan guarantees this clock will never raise `EINVAL`.
  --- Returns `EINVAL` if clock isn't supported on platform.
  --- This function only fails if `clock` is invalid.
  --- This function goes fastest on Linux and Windows.

  --- - `SEEK_CUR`: Sets the file position to `position + offset`
  --- - `SEEK_END`: Sets the file position to `filesize + offset`
  --- Returns the new position relative to the start of the file.
  lseek: function(fd: number, offset: number, whence?: number): number

  --- unix.bind(sock, 1 << 24 | 0 << 16 | 0 << 8 | 1, 31337)
  --- `ip` and `port` both default to zero. The meaning of bind(0, 0)
  --- is to listen on all interfaces with a kernel-assigned ephemeral
  --- port number, that can be retrieved and used as follows:
  --- sock = assert(unix.socket())  -- create ipv4 tcp socket
  --- assert(unix.bind(sock))       -- all interfaces ephemeral port

  setsockopt: function(fd: number, level: number, optname: number, value: boolean | number): boolean

  --- `events` and `revents` may be any combination (using bitwise OR) of:
  --- - `POLLIN` (events, revents): There is data to read.
  --- - `POLLOUT` (events, revents): Writing is now possible, although may
  --- still block if available space in a socket or pipe is exceeded
  --- (unless `O_NONBLOCK` is set).
  --- - `POLLPRI` (events, revents): There is some exceptional condition
  --- (for example, out-of-band data on a TCP socket).
  --- - `POLLRDHUP` (events, revents): Stream socket peer closed
  --- connection, or shut down writing half of connection.
  --- - `POLLERR` (revents): Some error condition.
  --- - `POLLHUP` (revents): Hang up. When reading from a channel such as
  --- a pipe or a stream socket, this event merely indicates that the
  --- peer closed its end of the channel.
  --- - `POLLNVAL` (revents): Invalid request.
  --- If this is set to -1 then that means block as long as it takes until there's an

  shutdown: function(fd: number, how: number): boolean
  --- Manipulates bitset of signals blocked by process.
  --- - `SIG_BLOCK`: applies `mask` to set of blocked signals using bitwise OR
  --- - `SIG_UNBLOCK`: removes bits in `mask` from set of blocked signals
  --- - `SIG_SETMASK`: replaces process signal mask with `mask`
  --- `mask` is a unix.Sigset() object (see section below).
  --- For example, to temporarily block `SIGTERM` and `SIGINT` so critical
  --- work won't be interrupted, sigprocmask() can be used as follows:
  --- newmask = unix.Sigset(unix.SIGTERM)
  --- oldmask = assert(unix.sigprocmask(unix.SIG_BLOCK, newmask))

  sigprocmask: function(how: number, newmask: Sigset): Sigset
  --- - `unix.SIGINT`
  --- - `unix.SIGQUIT`
  --- - `unix.SIGTERM`
  --- - etc.
  --- - Lua function
  --- - `unix.SIG_IGN`
  --- - `unix.SIG_DFL`
  --- - `unix.SA_RESTART`: Enables BSD signal handling semantics. Normally
  --- i/o entrypoints check for pending signals to deliver. If one gets
  --- delivered during an i/o call, the normal behavior is to cancel the
  --- i/o operation and return -1 with `EINTR` in errno. If you use the
  --- `SA_RESTART` flag then that behavior changes, so that any function
  --- that's been annotated with @restartable will not return `EINTR`
  --- and will instead resume the i/o operation. This makes coding
  --- easier but it can be an anti-pattern if not used carefully, since
  --- poor usage can easily result in latency issues. It also requires
  --- one to do more work in signal handlers, so special care needs to
  --- be given to which C library functions are @asyncsignalsafe.
  --- - `unix.SA_RESETHAND`: Causes signal handler to be single-shot. This
  --- means that, upon entry of delivery to a signal handler, it's reset
  --- to the `SIG_DFL` handler automatically. You may use the alias
  --- `SA_ONESHOT` for this flag, which means the same thing.
  --- - `unix.SA_NODEFER`: Disables the reentrancy safety check on your signal
  --- handler. Normally that's a good thing, since for instance if your
  --- `SIGSEGV` signal handler happens to segfault, you're going to want
  --- your process to just crash rather than looping endlessly. But in
  --- some cases it's desirable to use `SA_NODEFER` instead, such as at
  --- times when you wish to `longjmp()` out of your signal handler and
  --- back into your program. This is only safe to do across platforms
  --- for non-crashing signals such as `SIGCHLD` and `SIGINT`. Crash
  --- handlers should use Xed instead to recover execution, because on
  --- Windows a `SIGSEGV` or `SIGTRAP` crash handler might happen on a
  --- separate stack and/or a separate thread. You may use the alias
  --- `SA_NOMASK` for this flag, which means the same thing.
  --- - `unix.SA_NOCLDWAIT`: Changes `SIGCHLD` so the zombie is gone and
  --- you can't call wait() anymore; similar but may still deliver the
  --- SIGCHLD.
  --- - `unix.SA_NOCLDSTOP`: Lets you set `SIGCHLD` handler that's only
  --- notified on exit/termination and not notified on `SIGSTOP`,
  --- `SIGTSTP`, `SIGTTIN`, `SIGTTOU`, or `SIGCONT`.
  --- Example:
  --- function OnSigUsr1(sig)
  --- gotsigusr1 = true
  --- end
  --- gotsigusr1 = false
  --- oldmask = assert(unix.sigprocmask(unix.SIG_BLOCK, unix.Sigset(unix.SIGUSR1)))
  --- assert(unix.sigaction(unix.SIGUSR1, OnSigUsr1))
  --- assert(unix.raise(unix.SIGUSR1))
  --- assert(not gotsigusr1)
  --- ok, err = unix.sigsuspend(oldmask)
  --- assert(not ok)
  --- assert(err:errno() == unix.EINTR)
  --- assert(gotsigusr1)
  --- assert(unix.sigprocmask(unix.SIG_SETMASK, oldmask))
  --- It's a good idea to not do too much work in a signal handler.
  sigaction: function(sig: number, handler?: function | number, flags?: number, mask?: Sigset): function | number, number, Sigset
  --- Waits for signal to be delivered.
  --- The signal mask is temporarily replaced with `mask` during this system call.
  sigsuspend: function(mask?: Sigset): nil, Errno
  --- Causes `SIGALRM` signals to be generated at some point(s) in the
  --- future. The `which` parameter should be `ITIMER_REAL`.
  --- Here's an example of how to create a 400 ms interval timer:

  --- assert(unix.sigaction(unix.SIGALRM, function(sig)
  --- print('tick no. %d' % {ticks})
  --- ticks = ticks + 1
  --- end))
  --- assert(unix.setitimer(unix.ITIMER_REAL, 0, 400e6, 0, 400e6))
  --- while true do
  --- unix.sigsuspend()
  --- end
  --- Here's how you'd do a single-shot timeout in 1 second:
  --- unix.sigaction(unix.SIGALRM, MyOnSigAlrm, unix.SA_RESETHAND)
  --- unix.setitimer(unix.ITIMER_REAL, 0, 0, 1, 0)
  setitimer: function(which: number, intervalsec: number, intervalns: number, valuesec: number, valuens: number): number, number, number, number
  --- Turns platform-specific `sig` code into its symbolic name.
  --- For example:
  --- >: unix.strsignal(9)

  --- Please note that signal numbers are normally different across
  --- supported platforms, and the constants should be preferred.
  strsignal: function(sig: number): string
  --- Changes resource limit.
  --- - `RLIMIT_AS` limits the size of the virtual address space. This
  --- will work on all platforms. It's emulated on XNU and Windows which
  --- means it won't propagate across execve() currently.
  --- - `RLIMIT_CPU` causes `SIGXCPU` to be sent to the process when the
  --- soft limit on CPU time is exceeded, and the process is destroyed
  --- when the hard limit is exceeded. It works everywhere but Windows
  --- where it should be possible to poll getrusage() with setitimer().
  --- - `RLIMIT_FSIZE` causes `SIGXFSZ` to sent to the process when the
  --- soft limit on file size is exceeded and the process is destroyed
  --- when the hard limit is exceeded. It works everywhere but Windows.
  --- - `RLIMIT_NPROC` limits the number of simultaneous processes and it
  --- should work on all platforms except Windows. Please be advised it
  --- limits the process, with respect to the activities of the user id
  --- as a whole.
  --- - `RLIMIT_NOFILE` limits the number of open file descriptors and it
  --- should work on all platforms except Windows (TODO).
  --- If a limit isn't supported by the host platform, it'll be set to
  --- 127. On most platforms these limits are enforced by the kernel and
  --- as such are inherited by subprocesses.

  --- Adjusts the nice value (scheduling priority) of the calling process.

  --- Restrict system operations.
  --- This can be used to sandbox your redbean workers. It allows finer
  --- customization compared to the `-S` flag.
  --- Pledging causes most system calls to become unavailable. On Linux the
  --- disabled calls will return EPERM whereas OpenBSD kills the process.
  --- Using pledge is irreversible. On Linux it causes PR_SET_NO_NEW_PRIVS
  --- to be set on your process.
  --- By default exit and exit_group are always allowed. This is useful
  --- for processes that perform pure computation and interface with the
  --- parent via shared memory.
  --- Once pledge is in effect, the chmod functions (if allowed) will not
  --- permit the sticky/setuid/setgid bits to change. Linux will EPERM here
  --- and OpenBSD should ignore those three bits rather than crashing.
  --- User and group IDs also can't be changed once pledge is in effect.
  --- OpenBSD should ignore the chown functions without crashing. Linux
  --- will just EPERM.
  --- Memory functions won't permit creating executable code after pledge.
  --- Restrictions on origin of SYSCALL instructions will become enforced
  --- on Linux (cf. msyscall) after pledge too, which means the process
  --- gets killed if SYSCALL is used outside the .privileged section. One
  --- exception is if the "exec" group is specified, in which case these
  --- restrictions need to be loosened.
  --- This list has been curated to focus on the
  --- system calls for which this module provides wrappers. See the
  --- Cosmopolitan Libc pledge() documentation for a comprehensive and
  --- authoritative list of raw system calls. Having the raw system call
  --- list may be useful if you're executing foreign programs.

  --- ### id
  --- Allows setuid, setreuid, setresuid, setgid, setregid, setresgid,
  --- setgroups, setrlimit, getpriority, setpriority.
  --- ### settime
  --- Allows settimeofday and clock_adjtime.
  --- ### unveil
  --- Allows unveil().
  --- ### exec
  --- Allows execve.
  --- If the executable in question needs a loader, then you will need
  --- "rpath prot_exec" too. With APE, security is strongest when you
  --- assimilate your binaries beforehand, using the --assimilate flag,
  --- or the o//tool/build/assimilate program. On OpenBSD this is
  --- mandatory.
  --- ### prot_exec
  --- Allows mmap(PROT_EXEC) and mprotect(PROT_EXEC).
  --- This may be needed to launch non-static non-native executables,
  --- such as non-assimilated APE binaries, or programs that link
  --- dynamic shared objects, i.e. most Linux distro binaries.
  --- In that case, this specifies the promises that'll apply once `execve()`
  --- happens. If this is `NULL` then the default is used, which is
  --- unrestricted. OpenBSD allows child processes to escape the sandbox
  --- (so a pledged OpenSSH server process can do things like spawn a root
  --- shell). Linux however requires monotonically decreasing privileges.
  --- This function will will perform some validation on Linux to make
  --- sure that `execpromises` is a subset of `promises`. Your libc
  --- wrapper for `execve()` will then apply its SECCOMP BPF filter later.
  --- Since Linux has to do this before calling `sys_execve()`, the executed
  --- process will be weakened to have execute permissions too.
  --- - `unix.PLEDGE_PENALTY_KILL_THREAD` causes the violating thread to
  --- be killed. This is the default on Linux. It's effectively the
  --- same as killing the process, since redbean has no threads. The
  --- termination signal can't be caught and will be either `SIGSYS`
  --- or `SIGABRT`. Consider enabling stderr logging below so you'll
  --- know why your program failed. Otherwise check the system log.
  --- - `unix.PLEDGE_PENALTY_KILL_PROCESS` causes the process and all
  --- its threads to be killed. This is always the case on OpenBSD.
  --- - `unix.PLEDGE_PENALTY_RETURN_EPERM` causes system calls to just
  --- return an `EPERM` error instead of killing. This is a gentler
  --- solution that allows code to display a friendly warning. Please
  --- note this may lead to weird behaviors if the software being
  --- sandboxed is lazy about checking error results.
  --- `mode` may optionally bitwise or the following flags:
  --- - `unix.PLEDGE_STDERR_LOGGING` enables friendly error message
  --- logging letting you know which promises are needed whenever
  --- violations occur. Without this, violations will be logged to
  --- `dmesg` on Linux if the penalty is to kill the process. You
  --- would then need to manually look up the system call number and
  --- then cross reference it with the cosmopolitan libc pledge()
  --- documentation. You can also use `strace -ff` which is easier.
  --- This is ignored OpenBSD, which already has a good system log.
  --- Turning on stderr logging (which uses SECCOMP trapping) also
  --- means that the `unix.WTERMSIG()` on your killed processes will
  --- always be `unix.SIGABRT` on both Linux and OpenBSD. Otherwise,
  --- Linux prefers to raise `unix.SIGSYS`.
  pledge: function(promises?: string, execpromises?: string, mode?: number): boolean
  --- Restricts filesystem operations, e.g.
  --- unix.unveil(".", "r");     -- current dir + children visible
  --- unix.unveil("/etc", "r");  -- make /etc readable too
  --- unix.unveil(nil, nil);     -- commit and lock policy
  --- Unveiling restricts a thread's view of the filesystem to a set of
  --- allowed paths with specific privileges.
  --- Once you start using unveil(), the entire file system is considered
  --- hidden. You then specify, by repeatedly calling unveil(), which paths
  --- should become unhidden. When you're finished, you call `unveil(nil,nil)`
  --- which commits your policy, after which further use is forbidden, in
  --- the current thread, as well as any threads or processes it spawns.
  --- There are some differences between unveil() on Linux versus OpenBSD.
  --- 1. Build your policy and lock it in one go. On OpenBSD, policies take
  --- effect immediately and may evolve as you continue to call unveil()
  --- but only in a more restrictive direction. On Linux, nothing will
  --- happen until you call `unveil(nil,nil)` which commits and locks.
  --- 2. Try not to overlap directory trees. On OpenBSD, if directory trees
  --- overlap, then the most restrictive policy will be used for a given
  --- file. On Linux overlapping may result in a less restrictive policy
  --- and possibly even undefined behavior.
  --- 3. OpenBSD and Linux disagree on error codes. On OpenBSD, accessing
  --- paths outside of the allowed set raises ENOENT, and accessing ones
  --- with incorrect permissions raises EACCES. On Linux, both these
  --- cases raise EACCES.
  --- 4. Unlike OpenBSD, Linux does nothing to conceal the existence of
  --- paths. Even with an unveil() policy in place, it's still possible
  --- to access the metadata of all files using functions like stat()
  --- and open(O_PATH), provided you know the path. A sandboxed process
  --- can always, for example, determine how many bytes of data are in
  --- /etc/passwd, even if the file isn't readable. But it's still not
  --- possible to use opendir() and go fishing for paths which weren't
  --- previously known.
  --- This system call is supported natively on OpenBSD and polyfilled on
  --- Linux using the Landlock LSM[1].
  --- - `r` makes `path` available for read-only path operations,
  --- corresponding to the pledge promise "rpath".
  --- - `w` makes `path` available for write operations, corresponding
  --- to the pledge promise "wpath".
  --- - `x` makes `path` available for execute operations,
  --- corresponding to the pledge promises "exec" and "execnative".
  --- - `c` allows `path` to be created and removed, corresponding to
  --- the pledge promise "cpath".

  --- - `/zip/usr/share/zoneinfo/Sydney`     Z+10
  --- You can control which timezone is used using the `TZ` environment

  --- fd = assert(unix.open("hello.txt", unix.O_RDONLY))
  --- st = assert(unix.fstat(fd))
  --- Log(kLogInfo, 'hello.txt is %d bytes in size' % {st:size()})
  --- unix.close(fd)
  fstat: function(fd: number): Stat
  --- Opens directory for listing its contents.
  --- For example, to print a simple directory listing:
  --- Write('<ul>\r\n')
  --- for name, kind, ino, off in assert(unix.opendir(dir)) do
  --- if name ~= '.' and name ~= '..' then
  --- Write('<li>%s\r\n' % {EscapeHtml(name)})
  --- end
  --- end
  --- Write('</ul>\r\n')
  opendir: function(path: string): Dir
  --- Opens directory for listing its contents, via an fd.
  --- @param fd integer should be created by `open(path, O_RDONLY|O_DIRECTORY)`.
  --- The returned `unix.Dir` takes ownership of the file descriptor
  --- and will close it automatically when garbage collected.
  fdopendir: function(fd?: any): function, Dir
  --- Returns true if file descriptor is a teletypewriter. Otherwise nil
  --- with an Errno object holding one of the following values:
  --- - `ENOTTY` if `fd` is valid but not a teletypewriter
  --- - `EBADF` if `fd` isn't a valid file descriptor.
  --- - `EPERM` if pledge() is used without `tty` in lenient mode
  --- No other error numbers are possible.
  isatty: function(fd: number): boolean
  tiocgwinsz: function(fd: number): number, number
  --- Returns file descriptor of open anonymous file.
  --- This creates a secure temporary file inside `$TMPDIR`. If it isn't
  --- defined, then `/tmp` is used on UNIX and GetTempPath() is used on
  --- the New Technology. This resolution of `$TMPDIR` happens once.
  --- Once close() is called, the returned file is guaranteed to be
  --- deleted automatically. On UNIX the file is unlink()'d before this
  --- function returns. On the New Technology it happens upon close().
  --- On the New Technology, temporary files created by this function
  --- should have better performance, because `kNtFileAttributeTemporary`
  --- asks the kernel to more aggressively cache and reduce i/o ops.
  tmpfd: function(): number
  --- Relinquishes scheduled quantum.
  sched_yield: function()
  --- Creates interprocess shared memory mapping.
  --- This function allocates special memory that'll be inherited across
  --- fork in a shared way. By default all memory in Redbean is "private"
  --- memory that's only viewable and editable to the process that owns
  --- it. When unix.fork() happens, memory is copied appropriately so
  --- that changes to memory made in the child process, don't clobber
  --- the memory at those same addresses in the parent process. If you
  --- don't want that to happen, and you want the memory to be shared
  --- similar to how it would be shared if you were using threads, then
  --- you can use this function to achieve just that.
  --- The memory object this function returns may be accessed using its
  --- methods, which support atomics and futexes. It's very low-level.
  --- For example, you can use it to implement scalable mutexes:
  --- mem = unix.mapshared(8000 * 8)
  --- LOCK = 0 -- pick an arbitrary word index for lock
  --- -- From Futexes Are Tricky Version 1.1 § Mutex, Take 3;
  --- -- Ulrich Drepper, Red Hat Incorporated, June 27, 2004.
  --- function Lock()
  --- local ok, old = mem:cmpxchg(LOCK, 0, 1)
  --- if not ok then
  --- if old == 1 then
  --- old = mem:xchg(LOCK, 2)
  --- end
  --- while old > 0 do
  --- mem:wait(LOCK, 2)
  --- old = mem:xchg(LOCK, 2)
  --- end
  --- end
  --- end
  --- function Unlock()
  --- old = mem:add(LOCK, -1)
  --- if old == 2 then
  --- mem:store(LOCK, 0)
  --- mem:wake(LOCK, 1)
  --- end
  --- end
  --- It's possible to accomplish the same thing as unix.mapshared()
  --- using files and unix.fcntl() advisory locks. However this goes
  --- significantly faster. For example, that's what SQLite does and
  --- we recommend using SQLite for IPC in redbean. But, if your app
  --- has thousands of forked processes fighting for a file lock you
  --- might need something lower level than file locks, to implement
  --- things like throttling. Shared memory is a good way to do that
  --- since there's nothing that's faster.
  --- The `size` parameter needs to be a multiple of 8. The returned
  --- memory is zero initialized. When allocating shared memory, you
  --- should try to get as much use out of it as possible, since the
  --- overhead of allocating a single shared mapping is 500 words of
  --- resident memory and 8000 words of virtual memory. It's because
  --- the Cosmopolitan Libc mmap() granularity is 2**16.
  --- This system call does not fail. An exception is instead thrown
  --- if sufficient memory isn't available.
  mapshared: function(size: number): Memory
  --- Signal set for blocking, unblocking, and waiting on signals.
  --- Used with `unix.sigprocmask()`, `unix.sigaction()`, and `unix.sigsuspend()`.
  --- The unix.Sigset class defines a mutable bitset that may currently
  --- contain 128 entries. See `unix.NSIG` to find out how many signals
  --- your operating system actually supports.
  --- Constructs new signal bitset object.
  Sigset: function(sig: number, ...: number): Sigset
